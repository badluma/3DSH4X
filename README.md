This cool little application makes other think you can hack by displaying random commands on the top screen every time a button is pressed. These commands have no effect on your system, it's just looking cool. This app is mainly for me to learn the basics of devkitPro and C. I don't have much experience with this stuff, so **please don't expect too much from this repo**.

## Features

Press any button to display a random command.

## Feature Roadmap

Here are some features that I plan to impliment:

- Color Selection
- Command Type Selection (e.g. Python, C, bash, ...)
- Auto-Spam Mode
- .cia-Version
- ...

I don't guarantee that these features will actually appear.

**Have fun :)**
